# Bitwise-Manipulation-Game
Using the shortest number of manipulations convert 1 byte to another - made using Python3

## Requirements
- Allow the user to logical shift a binary number 
- Allow the user to arithmetic shift a binary number
- Show the effect the shifting has by showing the denary values before and after the shifts. 
- Allow the user to bit mask the binary using AND OR  
- Create a two bytes of binary and record the number of bitwise manipulations needed to convert between the two 
- Allow signed binary
- Make it graphical 
- The program works out the shortest number of steps to change between the two numbers and shows the answer.
- The program shows an animation of the bits moving. 

## How to run and use
Download zip file and extract, then run 'gui.py' (python must be installed to user path or global path)

For instructions on how to play the game click on the help icon in the bottom left of the window to read the user instruction set

## What I learnt
- Using images to create a more efficient gui
- Creating invisible rectangles in pygame
- Using control booleans effectively for inputs and mode selection
- Creating a help window
- How to make an incredibly simple problem self solving program
- Bitwise operation implementation
- Basic animation with pygame

## Improvements
- Would look at making a help window using the same background image
  - makes it more appealing
  - makes it more consistent
  - makes it more efficient, as only need to output a single complex image rather than calling a draw function multiple times for simpler outputs
- Potentially make a more complex animation that looks good, currently most animation possibilities aren't attractive
